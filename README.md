# Chat with Node.js

This application uses sockets to create a simple chat organized in rooms.
In order for two or more people to communicate, they need to enter the same room.
There is no limit on how many rooms can be created and the room names are not case sensitive.

There is no database to record the conversations, so feel free to say whatever you want and you won't be spied :)
