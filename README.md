# Chat with Node.js

This application uses sockets to create a simple chat organized in rooms.
In order for two or more people to communicate, they need to enter the same room.
There is no limit on how many rooms can be created and the room names are not case sensitive.

There is no database to record the conversations, so feel free to say whatever you want and you won't be spied :)

The app works in Node.js, so you need node installed on your machine before starting the server


## Start the Server
The following commands will run the server. The first one is the one that actually runs the app:

```
$npm run start
$npm run test
$npm run test-watch
```

Test suite is mocha.
